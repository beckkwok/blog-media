# CMS ↔ Agent connectivity via Payload MCP

Design note on how agents reach the CMS while preserving the access-control trust boundary.

## Decision: keep Payload CMS MCP (no custom gateway)

Verified against https://payloadcms.com/docs/plugins/mcp (`@payloadcms/plugin-mcp`). Access control is fully defined, so no alternative integration path is needed.

## Two-layer authorization model

1. **Config-level enable.** A collection/global is opted in per operation in the Payload config:

   ```ts
   mcpPlugin({
     collections: {
       posts: { enabled: { find: true, create: true, update: true, delete: false } },
     },
   })
   ```

2. **API Key-level allow/disallow.** Payload adds an **MCP → API Keys** admin collection. Each key is associated with a Payload **user**, and an admin toggles per-collection / per-global / per-tool capabilities on that key in real time. Requests without a valid Bearer key are rejected.

Per the docs: access controls are enforced at the Payload level **using the user associated with the API key**, so existing collection access rules, hooks, and role restrictions all continue to apply.

## Fit with AACMS

- An **Agent user** (user type `Agent`, scoped role) is the natural key owner. A key issued for that agent inherits the agent's least-privilege rules.
- Custom skill tools (`mcp.tools`) receive `(args, req)`; use `req.payload` and pass `req` through to operations with `overrideAccess: false` and `user: req.user` so the key owner's rules still gate the call.
- `onEvent` → audit / conversation log (feeds evaluation + observability roadmap).
- `overrideResponse` → sanitize fields before the model sees them.
- Hooks can branch on `req.payloadAPI === 'MCP'`.

## Custom skill tools exposed over MCP (v1)

In addition to the collection/global CRUD tools, AACMS registers framework **skill tools** via `mcp.tools` (see `src/agents/skills/`, documented in `docs/agents.md`). They appear in MCP `tools/list` and can be toggled per key.

| MCP tool name | Parameters | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `searchKnowledge` | `query: string`, `limit?: number` | `{ results: [{ content, similarity }] }` |
| `listContent` | `limit?: number` | `{ posts: [{ title, slug, excerpt, publishedDate }] }` |
| `getContent` | `slug: string` | `{ post: {…} \| null }` |
| `countContent` | *(none)* | `{ totalDocs: number }` |

Each tool handler receives `(args, req)` and runs the skill with `{ payload: req.payload, user: req.user }` using `overrideAccess: false`, so the API-key owner's access rules gate the call. Per-key allow/disallow lives in the **MCP → API Keys** collection (`payload_mcp_tool_*` fields).

## API key storage & masking

MCP keys are stored by the plugin as an encrypted `apiKey` + an HMAC `apiKeyIndex` (lookup). The key field is **masked server-side** via `overrideApiKeyCollection` (`src/payload.config.ts`): `afterRead` returns a bullet mask instead of the raw key, so Payload's admin API-key component (and any REST response) never exposes the plaintext. Trusted server reads reveal it with `context: { revealApiKey: true }`. On save, submitting the mask preserves the stored key and recomputes the HMAC index — so MCP auth keeps working. Verified by `tests/int/mcp-key-mask.int.spec.ts`.

## Decision: agent API-key policy (recorded for implementation)

- **One API key per agent** — best flexibility and clean audit identity per agent (conversations/tool calls attributable to a single key owner).
- **Plus one default/fallback API key** — a generic key used when no specific agent key applies (e.g. unauthenticated admin-side operations, bootstrapping, or an operation not tied to a single agent).

Implementation notes to honor when building:
- Provision the per-agent key on the Agent record; bind it to the Agent user so the key inherits that agent's access rules.
- Treat the fallback key as a distinct, least-privilege key — never a superset of agent keys.
- Rotation/revocation must be possible per key from the admin (MCP → API Keys), and fallback key must be revocable independently.
